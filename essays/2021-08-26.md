The University of Hawaii is no new turf for me. Back in 2013, I sat in an hour of traffic listening to my favorite Tiesto CD before parking my beaten-up Honda Accord in Zone 20. I sat in the campus center watching Hawaii News Now at 6:00am because I had overestimated the distance between UH and Kailua. At 7:45am, I decided it was time to find where the Art 101 classroom was, but thanks to my lack of preparation, I realized I had no idea where anything was. I frantically pulled up the UH website and tried to figure out the campus map. After 20 minutes of headless-chicken searching, I burst into Art 101 and began my journey at UH. Friends were made, lessons were learned, and tribulations were conquered. Almost a decade later, I have returned to UH after finishing a degree in Secondary Education Mathematics to pursue an interest that I am passionate about: data analytics and market research.

Although my experiences with teaching were great and afforded myself the opportunity to live abroad in Japan for a year teaching English, it never really filled the gap of achievement I was searching for. I respect the work that teachers do and have a whole new perspective on the struggles that any teacher endures, but I quickly realized that this was not a profession that I was cut out for. After spending a few months of self-reflection and working as a bartender, I had the revelation that I needed. I chose to become a teacher because of my love for mathematics. More so, because of my love for solving problems and presenting solutions. This drew me straight to marketing. I could assess the needs of a company and of consumers to create meaningful solutions. I could apply my passion for creative mediums to add value to a company or sustainable cause.

<p style="text-align:justify">
I started at Shidler in 2019 and got exposure to the wide range of fields that business jobs can offer. Most importantly, I found a field that applied a plethora of my interests: data analytics and market research. Not only could I work daily to solve the problems of a client, but I could also find creative mediums to present the results and solutions that I found to best deliver this information. Marketing was the way to go, and I am more excited than ever to pursue this field of education. But where does MIS come in? This is my first semester taking an ITM course with only ICS 111 to back myself up. Let's explore how I got to this point in my journey... 
</p>

## Expanded Usage of Analytical Software

<p style="text-align:justify">
After my exposure to Tableau in BUS 310, I knew that this was a powerful tool that many companies would hope to utilize. In fact, I have seen many positions in data analytics on LinkedIn that are asking for someone with experience in Tableau. While Tableau can do some amazing things, understanding the back end can expand its usage even further. Learning SQL really elevates the functionality of Tableau. Although MIS does not focus solely on computer programming, it develops exposure to this area and shows employers that you understand information systems. The core classes in the MIS program touch on every aspect of the field giving a broad range of understanding. This education and feel invaluable in an increasingly tech-dependent world.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Outside of Tableau, so many different facets of business can be supported by information systems. Website functionality can be supported by skills in HTML and CSS, Excel data can be easily analyzed with some custom-made scripts, and the infrastructure of a company can be supported by network proficiency. MIS isn't just another tag to add to my resume, it's a way to show employers than I can be an asset to the variety of functions in their company. I can use the software that they utilize daily and explore ways to expand its functionality.
</p>

## The Evolution of Technology

<p style="text-align:justify">
Technology is evolving fast, and many are struggling to keep up with a wide range of startups proficient in the field. Having a degree in MIS doesn't just show a company that I can troubleshoot why the Wi-Fi is down, but that I can help them adapt and survive.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Unlike some of my peers who grew up with iPhones and tablets, I grew up in the awkward era where cellphones were just starting to become popular. I vividly remember playing Rollercoaster Tycoon and getting upset that I couldn't lookup cheat codes on the Internet because my mom was talking to my grandma on the phone and using the dial-up. Although I safely can say that I grew up with technology, it isn't to the extent that someone ten years younger than me has. Therefore, I need to push myself a little more to develop this understanding that comes easier to a newer generation. While marketing covered a lot of the content that I need to be successful in market research, adding MIS as a double major has helped me to continue developing in the field of technology.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
After deciding to double major in MIS, I took on the extra load to also taking some ICS classes to supplement my learning. The business field is a massive "dog eat dog world" and failing to stay ahead in technology will only leave you behind in the dust. I saw MIS as a great opportunity to get ahead and be able to provide a wide range of value to my future employer. While this is not the easiest endeavor, it is the only way to survive in a world that continually requires technological expertise.
</p>

## Life-Long Learning

<p style="text-align:justify">
As the Henry Ford quote in the beginning of this essay suggests, the only thing that keeps us young is education. Once you stop learning, you begin aging and fading away. Yes, I'm back in school for marketing, which is a testament to this point, but why limit myself there? I saw MIS as a great opportunity to expand my education and to get a better understanding of how to add value to a business. Sure, I had to extend my stay at Shidler by a few months, but it will leave me with a toolset that is even greater than if I hadn't. Most importantly, MIS has inspired me to pursue another area of education: computer science. Now, I won't be getting a third degree in CS, but it has encouraged me to continue learning new things and to continue being a life-long learner. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
We are roughly slated 75 years on this planet, and I don't want to spend a moment not caring about why I'm here and what this world has to offer. Pursuing MIS has shown me that I can continue to push myself and learn things I never thought I would.
</p>

## So What?

<p style="text-align:justify">
I didn't intend on double majoring in MIS when I enrolled at Shidler, but I couldn't be more thankful that I did. From the value that it provides to an employer to the inspiration it has given me to continue developing myself in education, this is a pursuit that I will never regret. Perhaps this being my second degree, the burden of student loans that come from it, and the never-decreasing age I've reached are why I feel this way, but this experience only makes me appreciate it more. I am truly excited for this semester in ITM 352 and for the range of opportunities that it will give me to continue my life-long learning journey.
